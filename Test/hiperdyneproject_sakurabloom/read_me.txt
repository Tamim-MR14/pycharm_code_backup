Open the Exam(ENG).html file.

Open the Exam(ENG) .ipynb file to run the python codes.

All the .py files are rough files where I toggled and played around with different methods and tuned hyper parameters. 

In MLPRegressor, solver = 'lbfgs' was used, because in the documentation of MLPRegressor, it is mentioned that, lbfgs works well for data with less data. Also, activation = 'identity' was used because it provided best result and also, identity activation works wel for regression related problems.

Thank you.
